# gosandbox

## Introduction

A CLI tool written in Go to manage a single Sandbox instance in AWS.
This is a personal project and I have created it for the following reasons:

- To gain some familiarity with the AWS Go SDK.
- To write a practical tool that I can use to quickly pull
  up Linux instances for my own learning.
